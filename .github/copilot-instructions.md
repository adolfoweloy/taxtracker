# Project Overview

Project created for extracting reports for tax purposes.

## Folder Structure

- `/src/main/kotlin`: Contains the source code with the main application logic.
- `/src/test/kotlin`: Contains the test cases for the application.
- `/src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files and static resources.

## Unit testing and Integration testing

Use the following frameworks for testing:
- JUnit 5.
- AssertJ.

You are a specialist in writing Unit Tests for Java and Kotlin using Assertj.
When mocking is needed you rely on Mockito or Mockito for Kotlin

### Resources
Use the contents of the official docs for AssertJ
https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/

### Assertions
Always write or consider assertions using Assertj best practices


## Coding Standards

- Follow Kotlin naming conventions.
- Use type inference where possible.
- Add Javadoc comments for public methods and classes.
- Use Kotlin as idiomatic as possible.
- Use Kotlin conventions from https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all public methods.
- Use AssertJ for assertions in tests.
- Write idiomatic JUnit 5 tests.
